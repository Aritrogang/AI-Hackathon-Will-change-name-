# Katabatic — The System of Record for Stablecoin Reserve Risk

> Cornell AI Hackathon 2026 · Programmable Capital Track · 36 Hours · Mar 13–15

## Product Summary

Katabatic is **the system of record for stablecoin reserve risk** — a reserve risk data platform that continuously scores the structural fragility of stablecoin reserve portfolios and exposes that data via API. Not a rating agency (NRSRO liability avoided) and not a dashboard product — an **infrastructure layer** whose risk scores are consumed by DAO governance systems, DeFi protocol rebalancing logic, institutional risk desks, and (aspirationally) Chainlink oracle feeds.

The business model mirrors on-chain data infrastructure platforms: API-first, enterprise contracts, multi-modal delivery (REST API scores, warehouse delivery, real-time streaming). The GENIUS Act (Jul 2025) is to Katabatic what blockchain growth was to on-chain data platforms — the regulatory catalyst that made continuous reserve data programmatically accessible for the first time.

### Why "System of Record" Framing

On-chain data platforms became the authoritative source for on-chain behavioral data — the single source of truth that Visa, a16z, and Grayscale integrate into their own systems. Katabatic occupies the equivalent position for **off-chain reserve risk**: when a DAO treasury, DeFi protocol, or institutional risk desk needs to know the structural fragility of a stablecoin reserve, Katabatic is the authoritative score they integrate — not one of many dashboards they view.

**Output is consumed by systems, not just viewed by humans:**
- DAO governance contracts that auto-rebalance stablecoin exposure
- DeFi protocols that gate borrowing against a reserve health score
- Risk desks that embed the score into portfolio monitoring infrastructure
- Oracle feeds (Chainlink) for on-chain risk-gating (aspirational/demo mock layer)
- AI trading agents that query reserve risk via MCP tool calls before executing stablecoin positions

### Stack Positioning

Katabatic is to stablecoin reserve risk what on-chain data infrastructure platforms are to on-chain behavioral data — the authoritative, API-first data layer that systems integrate rather than humans browse. The business model is identical: API subscriptions, enterprise data contracts, warehouse delivery, real-time streaming. The GENIUS Act (Jul 2025) is the regulatory catalyst that made continuous reserve data programmatically accessible for the first time — the same unlock that blockchain growth provided for on-chain data.

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| On-chain data (Dune, Nansen, Chainalysis) | Mint/burn flows, wallet balances, transaction history |
| Off-chain regulatory (OCC XBRL, FDIC) | WAM, LTV ratios, bank health, reserve composition |
| **Reserve Risk — Katabatic** | **Stress Score = WAM × weather multiplier × concentration. API + streaming.** |
| Downstream consumers | DAO governance · DeFi protocols · Risk desks · Oracle feeds · AI agents (MCP) |

On-chain data platforms have no WAM duration engine, no FDIC Call Report mining, no weather tail-risk model, no reserve stress simulation. Katabatic ingests on-chain mint/burn data as *one input* into a multi-signal scoring engine combining off-chain regulatory filings + macroeconomic signals. **Complementary, not competing.**

**The key analogy (use this in pitches):** On-chain data platforms became the single source of truth for on-chain behavior — the data layer that Visa, a16z, and Grayscale integrate into their own systems. Katabatic is building the equivalent layer for off-chain reserve risk. When a DAO treasury or DeFi protocol needs to know the structural fragility of a stablecoin reserve, Katabatic is the score they integrate — not one of many dashboards they view.

### Core Insight

Stablecoin risk is a **duration mismatch problem** (SVB failure mode), not a credit problem. Weather and geopolitical events are *tail-risk multipliers* on an already-fragile balance sheet — the catalyst, not the cause.

**Output framing (legal-safe):** Instead of letter grades (requires NRSRO status), the API returns:
- `liquidity_stress_score` (0–100)
- `redemption_latency_hours` (e.g., 72 under stress)
- `liquidity_coverage_ratio` (e.g., 0.88 under Cat 4 + 50bps hike)
- `causal_narrative` (LLM-generated, multi-model consensus)

**Delivery modes:**
- REST API (score on demand, <2s re-score)
- Webhook/streaming (real-time score updates on new data)
- What-If simulator UI (demo-facing; shows the data product in action)
- Oracle mock (Chainlink-ready; scores pinned to IPFS via Pinata with verifiable CID)
- MCP server (AI-agent-native; risk scores as MCP tool calls for trading bots and agent frameworks)

**Target customers:** DAO Treasuries (MakerDAO, Aave, Compound), DeFi protocols holding stablecoin positions, institutional risk desks, stablecoin issuers needing GENIUS Act compliance tooling.

## Strategic Improvements Over Original Brief

### Hole 1: Data Opacity (30+ day PDF lag)
**Fix:** Under the 2025 GENIUS Act, PPSIs (Permitted Payment Stablecoin Issuers) must provide XBRL filings and OCC-standardized API feeds. Ingest these programmatically instead of scraping PDFs. Cross-reference OCC filings with on-chain Mint/Burn flows — if $1B USDC is burned, the engine checks for a corresponding decrease in cash at BNY Mellon or State Street.

### Hole 2: Causal Gap (hurricane → bank → downgrade is too blunt)
**Fix — two sub-signals:**
1. **Operational Risk:** Track Data Center Corridors, not bank branches. Treasury ops run on AWS/Azure. A hurricane hitting Northern Virginia (US-East-1) can freeze redemption processing even if the bank is fine.
2. **Credit Risk:** Use LLM to mine FDIC Call Reports. If a FL bank has high mortgage LTV ratios and a hurricane hits, the risk is a *liquidity squeeze from LTV deterioration*, not the bank physically flooding.

### Hole 3: Weather as Primary Signal (should be a multiplier)
**Fix:** Primary engine computes **Weighted Average Maturity (WAM)** of the treasury bond portfolio. Weather is a tail-risk multiplier:
```
Stress Score = Base Duration Risk × Weather Multiplier × Concentration Factor
```
This is why the SVB backtest works: SVB had extreme duration mismatch → weather/rate hike was just the catalyst for a run on an already-fragile balance sheet.

### Hole 4: "Rating Agency" Framing (NRSRO liability)
**Fix:** "Risk-as-a-Service Simulator." UI output is a What-If dashboard, not a grade. Sell to DAO treasuries who input scenarios and get operational outputs (latency, coverage ratio), not grades they could be sued over.

### Hole 5: Single-Source Trust Problem
**Fix:** Multi-model LLM consensus (Claude + Gemini) run inside a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). If all three models agree a stress threshold is crossed, the signal is pushed to a Chainlink oracle — making it grade-A data for DeFi protocols to automatically rebalance. **Score snapshots are pinned to IPFS via Pinata after each scoring run**, producing a content-addressable CID that serves as an immutable, verifiable proof of the score at a given timestamp. Downstream consumers (DAOs, DeFi protocols, Chainlink oracles) can independently verify the score was not tampered with by resolving the CID. *For the hackathon: demo with Claude + one other model as a "jury"; pin consensus scores to IPFS via Pinata API; display the IPFS CID alongside the mock TEE/Chainlink proof.*

## Scoring Engine: 6 Dimensions → Liquidity Stress Score

Each dimension scores 0–100. Weighted composite = final Liquidity Stress Score.

| # | Dimension | Method | Weight |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Duration Risk (WAM)** | Weighted Average Maturity of portfolio; longer = more fragile | 30% |
| 2 | **Reserve Transparency** | XBRL/OCC feed freshness + mint/burn cross-reference divergence | 20% |
| 3 | **Geographic + Operational Concentration** | HHI of bank locations + data center corridor overlap | 15% |
| 4 | **Weather Tail-Risk Multiplier** | Storm track × bank LTV exposure (FDIC Call Reports) | 15% |
| 5 | **Counterparty Health** | FDIC watch list status, LTV ratios, liquidity coverage (LLM-as-judge) | 15% |
| 6 | **Peg Stability** | Historical depeg events, current spread, mint/burn velocity | 5% |

**Final output mapping:**
```
Stress Score 0–25   → "Low Stress. Redemption latency: <4h. Coverage: 100%+"
Stress Score 26–50  → "Moderate Stress. Latency: 4–24h. Coverage: 95–100%"
Stress Score 51–75  → "Elevated Stress. Latency: 24–72h. Coverage: 85–95%"
Stress Score 76–100 → "Critical Stress. Latency: 72h+. Coverage: <85%"
```

- [ ] Endpoint: `GET /api/weather/active` — returns current weather stress events with ops impact
- [ ] Endpoint: `POST /api/weather/simulate` — accepts hurricane params, returns affected banks + data centers + WAM-adjusted stress scores

**feat/scoring-engine (Data/Scoring role)**
- [ ] WAM calculator: `duration_score = normalize(weighted_avg_maturity_days, 0, 365)`
- [ ] Weather multiplier: `weather_stress = ltv_stress × storm_category_factor × concentration_hhi`
- [ ] Operational risk score: binary flag if storm track hits any data center corridor serving the issuer
- [ ] LLM jury: call Claude + Gemini with same FDIC Call Report context; average their 0–100 counterparty health scores; flag if delta > 15 (models disagree)

**feat/dashboard (Frontend role)**
- [ ] Stress score table: all stablecoins with Liquidity Stress Score + redemption latency + coverage ratio
- [ ] Detail view: click a stablecoin → WAM chart, 6-dimension breakdown (Recharts), mint/burn divergence sparkline
- [ ] Alert banner: active weather events, mint/burn anomalies, FDIC watch list triggers
- [ ] Responsive layout matching Katabatic design language (purple accent `#7b6fc4`, light bg `#f4f3fa`)
- [ ] Framing copy: "Liquidity Stress Score" not "Rating" throughout all UI

**feat/what-if-simulator (Frontend + Graph/Weather roles)**
- [ ] Leaflet map layers:
  - Custodian bank markers (colored by stress contribution)
  - Data center corridor overlays (shaded regions for AWS/Azure zones)

- [ ] Output panel: always shows "Under this scenario: Latency Xh | Coverage Y%"

**feat/narratives (LLM/Extraction role)**
- [ ] Multi-model narrative generation:
  - Send same context to Claude + Gemini
  - If both models produce consistent causal chains → display narrative with "consensus" badge
  - If models diverge → surface both interpretations as "Model A / Model B" views
- [ ] Example output: "USDC stress score elevated to 68. 35% of reserves at BNY Mellon, which processes operations via AWS us-east-1 (Northern Virginia). Hurricane tracking toward the corridor could delay redemption processing. Separately, 22% exposure to FL regional banks shows LTV ratios of 0.71 in FDIC Call Reports — elevated given hurricane-driven property value stress."
- [ ] Endpoint: `POST /api/narratives` — accepts stress context, returns consensus narrative + model agreement score
- [ ] Display in dashboard detail view with consensus badge

- [ ] Tag `v0.3-simulator`

### Phase 4: Backtests & Trust Layer (Sat Night · Hours 20–26)

**feat/svb-backtest (Data/Scoring + LLM roles)**
- [ ] SVB time machine: load March 2023 data, replay stress scores day-by-day
- [ ] Key insight to show: SVB had a 2-year average WAM on treasuries → duration mismatch was the root cause; Fed rate hikes were the multiplier; the bank run was the outcome
- [ ] Show stress score crossing 75 ("Critical") ~48 hours before USDC depeg
- [ ] Annotate timeline: "Rate hike + long duration = fragile. Bank run = catalyst."
- [ ] Hurricane Ian replay (Sept 2022): show FL bank LTV stress propagation via FDIC Call Report data
- [ ] Timeline scrubber UI component for both backtests

**feat/demo-polish (Everyone)**
- [ ] Trust + Verification Layer:
  - Show "Model Consensus: Claude 68 | Gemini 71 | Delta: 3 → SIGNAL CONFIRMED" badge
  - Pin consensus score snapshot (JSON blob: score + narrative + timestamp + model scores) to IPFS via Pinata API
  - Display the returned IPFS CID: `ipfs://Qm...` (clickable, resolves to the pinned score data)
  - Endpoint: `POST /api/publish-score` — pins score to Pinata, returns `{ "cid": "Qm...", "ipfs_url": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qm...", "timestamp": "..." }`
  - Display alongside: "TEE-ready for Chainlink · Score verified on IPFS"
  - This positions Katabatic as oracle-grade infrastructure with verifiable, immutable score provenance
- [ ] Wire up all 3 demo scenarios end-to-end:
  - Scenario A: Hurricane → Northern Virginia data center corridor → ops risk + FL bank LTV stress → stress score spike (primary demo)
  - Scenario B: SVB collapse backtest — duration mismatch as root cause
  - Scenario C: 100bps rate hike → WAM sensitivity → show which stablecoins are most exposed
- [ ] Loading states, error handling, empty states
- [ ] Demo mode toggle: preload data, skip API latency with cached responses

- [ ] Tag `v0.4-backtests`

### Phase 5: Ship (Sun Morning · Hours 26–36)

- [ ] Code freeze at **hour 30**
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel, backend to Railway/Render
- [ ] Verify all 3 demo paths work on deployed URLs
- [ ] Rehearse demo script 5× (target: under 2 minutes)
- [ ] Prepare backup: pre-recorded screen capture of demo in case of live failure
- [ ] Final merge `dev` → `main`, tag `v1.0-demo`

## Demo Script (5 Beats, <2 Minutes)

1. **Show the stress score dashboard.** Six stablecoins with Liquidity Stress Scores and projected redemption latencies. "We ingest OCC regulatory filings, cross-reference on-chain Mint/Burn flows, and compute the Weighted Average Maturity of every reserve portfolio — continuously."

2. **Drop a hurricane on the map.** Two things happen simultaneously: Florida bank markers turn red as their mortgage LTV ratios deteriorate under the storm, and the Northern Virginia data center corridor lights up — because that's where treasury ops run. Stress score spikes. "This isn't a bank flooding. It's a liquidity squeeze from LTV deterioration and a 72-hour redemption delay from ops infrastructure exposure."

3. **Click into the causal explanation.** Two models (Claude + Gemini) independently generated the same narrative. Score pinned to IPFS — click the CID to verify. "Consensus confirmed. USDC stress score: 68. Redemption latency under this scenario: 72 hours. Liquidity coverage: 88%. Verified: ipfs://Qm..."

4. **SVB backtest.** Rewind to March 2023. Show the WAM chart — SVB was holding 2-year treasuries. Duration mismatch was already critical. The rate hike was just the match. "Our engine would have flagged this 48 hours before the depeg."

5. **Close the pitch.** "This is the difference between a rating agency and a risk engine. We don't give you a letter grade you can get sued over. We give you: 'Under a Cat 4 hitting the Gulf + 50bps hike, your USDC position shows 72-hour redemption latency and 88% coverage' — pinned to IPFS so anyone can verify it, consumed as an API call or an MCP tool call. That's what DAO treasuries, DeFi protocols, and AI agents need. That's Katabatic."

## Task Tracking

All project work is tracked in **`TASKS.md`** at the repo root. This is the master task list.

**Claude must follow these rules without exception:**
- When any task in `TASKS.md` is completed, immediately edit `TASKS.md` to mark it `[x]`
- Update the `Progress Tracker` table at the bottom of `TASKS.md` when a phase is fully complete
- Update the `Last updated` date in `TASKS.md` whenever the file is modified
- Never mark a task complete unless the implementation is verified and working
- If a new sub-task is discovered during implementation, add it to `TASKS.md` before starting it

---

## Conventions

- Commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:` prefixes
- Python: Black formatter, type hints, docstrings on public functions
- React: Functional components, hooks only, no class components
- All API responses follow: `{ "data": ..., "error": null, "timestamp": "..." }`
- Branch names: `feat/short-description`, `fix/short-description`
- Never use "rating" or "grade" in UI copy — always "Liquidity Stress Score" or "stress level"

### Security — THIS IS A PUBLIC REPO

**Claude must follow these rules without exception:**
- **NEVER** write API keys, tokens, passwords, or secrets into any file other than `.env` (which is gitignored)
- **NEVER** hardcode credentials in source code — always read from `os.getenv()` or `import.meta.env`
- **NEVER** commit `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, or any file matching `*secret*`
- **NEVER** log or print API key values — only log whether a key is set or missing
- Before every commit, verify no secrets are staged: check `git diff --cached` for API keys, tokens, or passwords
- Use `.env.example` with empty values as the template — never populate it with real keys
- If you accidentally write a secret to a tracked file, **immediately** remove it and warn the user that the key must be rotated (git history preserves secrets even after deletion)
